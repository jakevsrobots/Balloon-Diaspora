    <line>No, no, you don't understand us. I can't go any further with you.</line>

    <line>Yes. That is why we stay here now -- three spires for the three islands that bear the sign of the Return.</line>
    <line>We reflect on the moon: a bright, white circle that looks the same here as it does in the Balloon Archipelago. Three spires, one moon, three islands.</line>
    <line>One day, instead of looking down at clouds we will be looking down at water again. Instead of hunting seagulls, we will be fishing. We will mend our balloons and our culture.</line>

  <scene name="aboutTheReturn" goto="root">
    <line>Our culture is in intermission, $[player_name], and only when all our people are back in the Balloon Archipelago can our story continue. Many of us left by choice, before the trouble started. Some of us were forced to leave.</line>
